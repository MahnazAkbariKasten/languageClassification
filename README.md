# languageClassification
This project is for building a model that classifies if the input text is in English or not. 
It uses this dataset: https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/master/samples/prediction/language_id.txt
The dataset has samples from 3 languages: English, Fernch, Spanish. For this project I need to change the dataset to label it 
as Englis or not.
Accordingly a binary classification model will be built to classify any text input.
